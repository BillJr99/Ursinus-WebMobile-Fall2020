excerpt: "Web and Mobile Development - Digital Signatures"

  goals: 
    - To explain and execute the process for public-key cryptography
    - To explain how public key cryptography is used to generate a digital signature that enforces non-repudiation

      title: Public-Key Cryptography
      questions:
        - Choose a secret numeric value that you want to send securely to a partner.
        - Fill in the nodes of the public map with integers that add up to the secret value you chose.
        - For each node, replace the value with the sum of itself plus the original value found in the adjacent neighbors.
        - Send this graph to your partner.  Can your partner figure out the value without any help (probably not!)?
        - Your partner (and only your partner) should look at the Private Map (see below), which highlights the nodes that should be added together to obtain the value.
        - How did this work?  If every student used a unique "map," how could you use this approach to send data securely to anyone?

      title: Digital Signatures
      questions:
        - If I encrypt something using someone's private map, who can decode it?
        - If I encrypt something using my own public map, who can decode it?
        - How could you use these maps to ensure that a particular person actually sent a particular value?
        - How can I use this approach to ensure that the data that I sent was not altered along the way?
