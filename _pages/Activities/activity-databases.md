  goals: 
    - To explain the role of relational databases in web service architectures
    - To normalize a database to minimize data duplication
    - To join databases by a primary and foreign key
    - To use the SQL language to insert, query, and update database tables

      title: The SQL Join
      questions:
        - What are the primary keys and foreign keys in the tables above?
        - "What do you think <code>JOIN</code> means?"
        - What is the resulting table generated by the query above?
        - Why not just have a single table with the course name, person name in it to begin with, like the one you obtained through the JOIN statement?

      title: "Sanitizing Database Inputs"
      questions:
        - What is the problem being demonstrated here?  How might you write a program that is vulnerable to this type of attack?
        - "What can we do to prevent this?  The solution is <a href=\"https://www.veracode.com/blog/secure-development/how-prevent-sql-injection-nodejs\">provided automatically by a node.js library</a>, which you should use when concatenating user input to executable code."

      questions:
        - In the first example, why is the code hard to follow?
        - "If you put a <code>process.exit()</code>statement at the bottom of the first example, what do you think would happen?"
        - "In the second example, why is there a <code>return</code> statement in the middle of execution?  This statement does not return from the function: what do you think it does?"
        - "What are the advantages and disadvantages of the <code>await</code> statements in the third example?"
