      questions:
        - What part of the URL represents the tweet ID?
        - How do we know which user made that tweet?
        - What CRUD verb do you think is executed on this URL (Create, Read, Update, Delete)?
        - What HTTP verb do you think is executed (POST, PUT, DELETE)?
        - What is the noun in this transaction?
        - What changes in the URL if we want to get a different tweet from the same user?
